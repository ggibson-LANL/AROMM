This folder contains the model development of our idealized river chemistry model, now extended to include multiple nodes (9 total) representing upstream to downstream river segments.
In this version (Multi_Node_Model_Permafrost_Test), we explore the sensitivity of downstream DOC evolution to changes in 
initial DOC concentrations. Specifically, we apply:<br>
- Slow chemical reactivity, and
- Modified initial DOC concentrations to perform a sensitivity test on the effect of DOC inputs.


These parameters are informed by findings from our initial two-node model:
 River_3000km_ChemicalReactivity(slow)_InitialDOC(lower).
By extending the model spatially while maintaining these validated chemical conditions, this version investigates how permafrost-influenced DOC compositions evolve along the river continuum. These simulations help identify key mechanisms driving dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in Arctic river systems.
