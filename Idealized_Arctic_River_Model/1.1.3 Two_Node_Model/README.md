This repository contains the first development of our idealized river chemistry model, structured with two nodes representing upstream and downstream river segments.
***Model (First Developed):
River_3000km_ChemicalReactivity(slow:fast)_InitialDOC(lower:upper)
 In this version, we explore how changes in:
-Chemical reactivity (ranging from slow to fast), and
-Initial DOC concentration (from lower to upper values)

affect the downstream evolution of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). These simulations help identify the most relevant combinations for representing Arctic river systems.

*** Model Extension:
River_3000km_Slow_Low_Sediments(Coastal_Region)
 This version builds upon the two-node structure by incorporating:<br>
 
-A new sediment-associated chemical reactivity term, and <br>
-The macromolecular behavior of DOC, particularly relevant in coastal environments.


This extension enhances the model's ability to simulate DOC transformations influenced by sediment interactions in Arctic river-coastal systems.
